Implement wordcount.
<---Fuckk this is hard--->
<---Main code--->
Start with a for loop.
Let's run it as long as i < wordcount.
Then let's get the decimal value of the selected character via index.
Then I'll make a function that converts the index into binary.
Then the value in binary will be returned and printed with a nextline.
